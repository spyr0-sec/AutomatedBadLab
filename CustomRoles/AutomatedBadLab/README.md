# AutomatedBadLab

This Role is not designed to be a cyber range such as [GOAD](https://github.com/Orange-Cyberdefense/GOAD) but a user controlled vulnerable domain to practise TTPs on. However, the ATTACK vectors are provisioned in a way where a handful of random AD users will be explotiable via a "Primary" method, then each of these accounts will have random subset of "Second" ATTACK Vectors if you do want to use this as an environment to teach others. 

As these are all split into individual PowerShell functions, AutomatedBadLab also offers a reference for each of these misconfigurations to gain a better understanding of why they introduce vulnerabilities to a domain.

A snapshot of the Domain Controller is taken twice during this role, once when the machine is promoted to a DC, and once again when AutomatedBadLab has finished its misconfiguring.

## Defining the role

``` PowerShell
$AutomatedBadLabRole = Get-LabPostInstallationActivity -CustomRole AutomatedBadLab -Properties @{
   UserCount           = 100 # Default 1000,
   GroupCount          = 100 # Default 100
   ComputerCount       = 150 # Default 1500
   VulnerableUserCount = 10  # Default (Get-Random -Minimum 4 -Maximum 11)
}

Add-LabMachineDefinition -Name DC01 -Role RootDC -PostInstallationActivity $AutomatedBadLabRole
```

## Output

Details of vulnerable user accounts are saved to the local directory:
``` PowerShell
$DC = Get-LabVM -Role RootDC
$DCSession = New-LabPSSession -ComputerName $DC
Receive-File -SourceFilePath C:\AutomatedBadLab.log -DestinationFilePath ".\$($DC.DomainName)_AutomatedBadLab.log" -Session $DCSession
Write-ScreenInfo "Downloaded logs to $PSScriptRoot\$($DC.DomainName)_AutomatedBadLab.log"
```

An example log file snippet is provided below:
```

```

## Multi-Domains 
AutomatedBadLab is also supported in Root / Child Domains and Forest scenarios. The [Forest Template](../../Labs/1.%20Template%20Forest.ps1) script provides an example of how it can be deployed on multiple Domain Controllers.
